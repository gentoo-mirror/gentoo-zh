		KGTP is a realtime and lightweight Linux debugger and tracer.
		It makes Linux Kernel supply a GDB remote debug interface. Then GDB in
		current machine or remote machine can debug and trace Linux through GDB
		tracepoint and some other functions without stopping the Linux Kernel.
		And even if the board doesn't have GDB on it and doesn't have interface
		for remote debug. It can debug the Linux Kernel using offline debug
