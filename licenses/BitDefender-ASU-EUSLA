  IF  YOU  DO  NOT  AGREE  TO  THESE  TERMS  AND CONDITIONS DO NOT INSTALL THE
  SOFTWARE. BY SELECTING "I ACCEPT", "OK", "CONTINUE", "YES" OR BY  INSTALLING
  OR  USING  THE  SOFTWARE  IN  ANY  WAY,  YOU  ARE  INDICATING  YOUR COMPLETE
  UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  These Terms cover the  home-user  or  corporate  BitDefender  Solutions  and
  Services licensed to you, including the related documentation and any update
  and upgrade of the applications delivered to you under the purchased license
  or  under any related service agreement, as defined in the documentation, as
  well as any copy thereof.

  This  License  Agreement  is  a  legal  agreement  between  you  (either  an
  individual  or  a  legal  person)  and  BITDEFENDER  for  the  use  of   the
  BITDEFENDER software  product  identified  above,  which  includes  computer
  software  and services,  and  may  include  the  associated  media,  printed
  materials, and "online" or electronic documentation (hereinafter referred to
  as "BitDefender"), all of which are  protected  by  international  copyright
  laws  and  international  treaties.  By   installing,   copying   or   using
  BitDefender, you agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.

  If  you  do  not agree to the terms of this agreement, do not install or use
  BitDefender.

  BitDefender  License. BitDefender  is  protected  by  copyright   laws   and
  international  copyright  treaties,  as  well as other intellectual property
  laws and treaties. BitDefender is licensed, not sold.

  GRANT OF LICENSE. BITDEFENDER hereby grants you and only you  the  following
  non-exclusive,  limited,  non-transferable  and  royalty-bearing  license to
  use BitDefender.

  The BitDefender Antivirus Scanner for Unices ("BitDefender") is subject to 3
  types of license:

  1.  Trial  License. The product is distributed with a trial key which grants
  the user a 30 day trial period as of install time, under the  terms  of  the
  license  agreement.  At the end of the trial period, all scan- based product
  features (disinfect, delete) will be disabled and  the  user  will  have  to
  either  go online to www.bitdefender.com and register for a personal license
  or purchase a commercial license from any BitDefender reseller.

  2. Home or Personal Use License. This license is free of charge and  it  can
  be  retrieved from the BitDefender website after filling in a short form. It
  only allows the product to be used for personal purposes, with no commercial
  implications whatsoever, under the terms of the EULA. For example, under the
  Personal License, you are allowed to scan your personal  laptop  or  desktop
  computer  but  YOU  ARE  NOT  ALLOWED  TO  USE  THE  PRODUCT  IN  A BUSINESS
  ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS AN OFFICE COMPUTER OR A COMPANY SERVER.

  3. Commercial Use License. If you intend to use BitDefender  with  your  own
  integration system or pre-designed scripts, you must purchase the Commercial
  License. The commercial license allows for the product to  be  used  in  any
  environment  whatsoever  throughout the licensing period, under the terms of
  the EULA. Commercial Licenses are granted on an individual user basis, which
  simply  means  that  the  cost  depends  on  how many users benefit from the
  features of the product.

  LICENSE TERM. The license hereunder is granted as of  the  date  BitDefender
  has  been  purchased  and until the end of the period for which such license
  has been purchased.

  UPGRADES. If BitDefender is upgrade labeled, in order to use  it,  you  must
  hold a BITDEFENDER license  allowing  you  to  use  products  identified  by
  such company  as  eligible  for  upgrade.  An  upgrade  labeled  BitDefender
  product  shall  replace  and/or  supplement  the  product  based  on   which
  your were eligibile for such upgrade. You may  use  the  resulting  upgraded
  product  only in accordance with the terms of  this  License  Agreement.  If
  BitDefender is an upgrade of a software package component which was licensed
  to  you  as  a single product, BitDefender may only be used and  transferred
  as part of that single product package and it may not be separated so as  to
  be used by  more than  the  total  number of licensed users. The  terms  and
  conditions  of  this  license  shall  replace  and  supersede  any  previous
  agreements  that  may  have existed  between  you  and BITDEFENDER regarding
  the  original product or the resulting upgraded product.

  COPYRIGHT. All rights, titles and interest in and  to  BitDefender  and  all
  copyrights  in  and to BitDefender (including but not limited to any images,
  photographs, logos, animations, video, audio,  music,  text,  and  "applets"

  notices shall be reproduced and included, in their original form, in all  of

  rented, sold, leased or shared. The BitDefender source  code  shall  not  be
  reverse engineered, recompiled, disassembled, no derivative works  shall  be
  created  based  on  it,  it  shall  not  be  modified,  translated  and   no
  attempts to discover it shall be made.

  LIMITED WARRANTY. BITDEFENDER warrants a 30 day fault free  period  for  the
  media on which  BitDefender  is  distributed  as of the date BitDefender has
  been delivered to you. Any breach of this  warranty  shall  only  result  in
